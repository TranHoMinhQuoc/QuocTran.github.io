## Projects
### Partial Equilibrium Model with Rstudio and SQL

![PE Model0](/assets/DS.png)

Contributed to the development of a partial equilibrium model using **SQL, RStudio, RShiny**, and **Microsoft Power BI** for granular sector analysis at the product line level. The model, based on the United Nations ESCAP model and similar to the SMART model in the World Bank's WITS, analyzes up to 5300 products at the HS6 level and multiple source countries. It supports the simulation of various scenarios, including tariff changes and free trade agreements (FTAs).

A 3D interactive interface was built in **Power BI** to enable users to navigate through sectors and visually analyze trade impacts such as trade creation and diversion. This tool offers a dynamic and user-friendly way to interact with simulation results, supporting decision-making and deeper analysis.
